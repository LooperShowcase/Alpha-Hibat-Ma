    <h2 id="p3">What makes a great volleyball ball?</h2>
    <p id="p1">
      It’s easy to see why volleyball is becoming one of the most popular sports
      in the world. High speed spikes, big bodied blocks, and players diving all
      over the court make it incredibly exciting to witness. With that being
      said, it’s important to remember what makes it all possible.
    </p>
    <p id="p1">
      The volleyball ball is an integral part of the game that we all know and
      love. It’s specifically designed for the perfect amount of velocity and
      bounce while being padded enough to not become a danger to players. Have
      you ever tried to play volleyball with a soccer ball? It hurts!
    </p>
    <p id="p1">
      So what makes for a great volleyball? The three most important factors
      that determine the quality of a volleyball ball are it’s measurements,
      outer shell, and bladder.
    </p>
    <ul id="p1">
      <li>
        <h2>Volleyball Ball Measurements -</h2>
        <p>
          Typically, an indoor volleyball ball has a circumference of 25.5-26.5
          inches, an inside pressure of 4.26-4.61 psi, and a weight of 9.2-9.9
          ounces. This may vary depending on a player’s age, gender, and skill
          level.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Volleyball Ball Outer Shell -</h2>
        <p>
          The outer shell of a volleyball ball is incredibly important. Not only
          does it impact things like grip and cushion, but it can also alter the
          volleyball’s flightpath.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Volleyball Ball Bladder-</h2>
        <p>
          The bladder of a volleyball ball is the inside that allows the ball to
          be sfilled with air. Without a proper bladder, a volleyball ball will
          have inconsistent “bounce” and therefore become hard to control.

        <p id="p5">
          If you are looking to get the volleyball ball that they use in both
          the Olympics and FIVB, look no further than the Mikasa V200W. While
          this Mikasa volleyball is a bit more expensive than some of the others
          on the list, it is regarded as the most universally used in
          professional volleyball.
        </p>

        <h2>Mikasa V200W Volleyball Ball - Pros</h2>
        <p id="p5">The first thing that you will notice about the volleyball ball is the color scheme. The ball is a blend of yellow and blue which “pops” in a way that it is less likely to get lost in the light. The initial feel of the grip is quite nice which can be attributed to the dimpled surface. Using a dimpled surface also aids in keeping the path as straight as possible (similar to the dimpled surface of a golf ball).</p>

        <p>Hitters oftentimes love the Mikasa V200W due to the reassuring sound made during an attack. The loud smack leads to immediate gratification and will surely turn some heads. While it shouldn’t be the sole reason you purchase this volleyball ball, intimidating the opposing team during warm-ups definitely has an impact on how you play.</p>

        <p>The Mikasa engineering team puts a lot of research into their products and it certainly shows. Listed below are the highlighted features the volleyball has.</p>
